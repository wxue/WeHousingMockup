# We Housing Mock-up
> Coding Exercise

## Tasks

Finished all the tasks. 

For advance, the apartment list can be sorted both descending and ascending by click on those buttons.  

### Tech

Bootstrap + AngularJS

> jQuery is only loaded for bootstrap.js, and bootstrap.js is only used for detail modal display and fading animation.

> Files in "lib" are third part libraries.

### Browser Support

Tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Not tested in Widows environment with IE/Edge yet, but it should works fine as well.

Could also viewed by mobile device, however, I didn't spend too much time on that. I could make it more responsive.

### Notice:

I used my mac to fire up a simple python based http server.

You can ignore "run.py", it's only a http server set up script, and use your own http server.

You are welcomed to log my commit to see how I build it up.

Untested bugs might occur, please let know if you find some, thanks.
